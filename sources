Some random places I've found for getting data

school zones
https://koordinates.com/layer/743-nz-school-zones-sept-2010/download/

lots of interesting stuff here, including school locations
https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset
https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/directory-of-educational-institutions/resource/bdfe0e4c-1554-4701-a8fe-ba1c8e0cc2ce

linz, plenty of stuff including LiDAR, haven't actually downloaded any
of it to check it
https://data.linz.govt.nz/data/global/oceania/new-zealand/canterbury/christchurch-city/

Canterbury maps, again plenty here, zoning, boundaries, water etc.
Links to other places too.  There is a nice map of schools and zones,
and they say where they got their data (data.govt.nz and
koordinates.com?).  If you click on Explore when on a map you can
scroll down to various stuff including the Bus map
